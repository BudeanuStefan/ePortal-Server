It was less about algorithms and more about structure and putting the pieces together. Web Development is a large field and Colt did a great job on focusing on the main important parts. He touches on html, css, frameworks, libraries, node.js, mongodb, git/github, heroku and complex JS topics towards the end. If someone asks me where can I learn how to create full stack websites as a beginner I will for sure recommend Colt's course as the first option. It gives you a solid foundation on how to create full stack web apps/sites. My skill level increased enormously I felt like I just turned Super Saiyan!!!!"
