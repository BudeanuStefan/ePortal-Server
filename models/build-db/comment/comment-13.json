    "content": "I liked the course as it's quite structured for person with basic to intermediate general marketing knowledge. The digital portion may be difficult if a person doesn't have basic knowledge on the various digital platforms out there.I felt that the lectures could do better with Powerpoint slides rather than highlighting with the cursor. It would also be more complete if Instagram and LinkedIn can be included in the course.Overall, a good course to get a basic to intermediate understanding of marketing on the various digital platforms."
