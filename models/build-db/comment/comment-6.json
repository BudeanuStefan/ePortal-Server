    "content": "Tony does a great job in not only explaining the code but delves into what is going on under the hood in some instances of looking at the source code of the V-8 engine.  He also does a very thorough job in explaining the \"why\" during the coding exercises .  You will not only learn Node.js but get a deep understanding of Node related topics.  The first half of the course in more theoretical and lays a good foundation for the hand-on coding exercises that he walks through.  I highly recommend this course for anyone who is interesting in learning Node.  This should be your first course in Node."
