  "description": "A data warehouse (DW) is a collection of corporate information and data derived from operational systems and external data sources. A data warehouse is designed to support business decisions by allowing data consolidation, analysis and reporting at different aggregate levels. Data is populated into the DW through the processes of extraction, transformation and loading. This course provides an introduction to data warehouse design. Topics in  data modeling, database design and database access are reviewed.  Issues in data warehouse planning, design, implementation, and administration are discussed in a seminar format.   The role of data warehouse in supporting Decision Support Systems (DSS) is also reviewed."
