  "description" : "In 2006, Neal Ford coined the term polyglot programming, to express the idea that applications should be written in a mix of languages to take advantage of the fact that different languages are suitable for tackling different problems. Complex applications combine different types of problems, so picking the right language for each job may be more productive than trying to fit all aspects into a single language. This same concept can be applied to databases; so that you can have an application that talks to different databases using each for what they are best at to achieve an end goal, thus giving birth to polyglot persistence."
